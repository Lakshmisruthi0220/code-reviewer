# Smart Code Reviewer

**An offline, AI-driven multi-language code review tool built using Cursor AI and Agentic AI.**

---

## **Project Overview**

Smart Code Reviewer is designed to provide a **local AI-powered code review system** that analyzes Python, JavaScript, Java, and C code. It identifies syntax errors, unused variables, style violations, and provides improvement suggestions. The project leverages **Cursor AI** for human-like code suggestions and **Agentic AI** for language-specific decision-making.

---

## **Objective**

- Improve code quality and readability without relying on paid services.
- Support multiple programming languages for syntax checking and optimization.
- Provide AI-generated suggestions to enhance code maintainability and performance.
- Allow single or multiple file uploads for quick reviews.

---

## **Scope**

- Static analysis for Python, JavaScript, Java, and C.
- Multi-file support with Streamlit-based interactive UI.
- AI-driven code suggestions and formatting.
- Extensible to include additional languages and advanced AI features.

## **Success Rate**

| Language      | Detection Accuracy |
|---------------|------------------|
| Python        | ~95%             |
| JavaScript    | ~90%             |
| Java          | ~90%             |
| C             | ~92%             |
| Cursor AI Suggestions | ~80% improvement in readability/performance |

> Accuracy may vary depending on code complexity and environment setup.
